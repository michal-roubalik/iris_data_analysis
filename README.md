# Iris size - Data analysis project
This is my first project at GitHub, its purpose is to create easy simple piece of code and practise GIT methodology while having fun with simple pictures etc. 
## Structure of the project
`guiding_notebook.ipynb` Jupyter notebook as interactive tool showing the implemented analysis. <br>
`iris.csv` datafile with source data. <br>
`functions.py` implemented functions needed to run the analysis. <br>
